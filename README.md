# GOPH 419 – Computational Methods for Geophysicists
*Semester:* F2025
*Instructor:* B. Karchewski
*Author:* <Ava Keerak>

This repository provides the code for GOPH 419 Lab 1, which is adapted from Problem 4.18 in Chapra and Canale (2015). The purpose of this lab was to simulate a control system that determines the allowable launch angle required for a rocket’s first stage to reach a desired maximum altitude using custom numerical functions without relying on external libraries.
